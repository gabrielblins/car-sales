# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data
This is the first project of [DCA0305 - Machine Learning Based Systems Design](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/mlops#dca0305---machine-learning-based-systems-design) class and the guided project of "Practice data cleaning and data exploration using pandas" module of [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io)
<br>
In this project I will work with the eBay Kleinanzeigen used cars dataset, I'm using a modified version of this dataset provided by Dataquest.<br>
You can find the unmodified dataset in this [link](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data)
<br>
The aim of this project is to clean and analyze the data of the used cars, trying to extract some useful information and applying the concepts learned during the course.
